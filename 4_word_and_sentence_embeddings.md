# Word and Sentence Embeddings
It is important to find useful embeddings especially ones where we can associate
meaning to words and sentences.
We want to be able to have similar words in meaning having a close vector and
similar sentences again close vectors.

This has many applications, for example search engines, where we need to compute
some sort of similarity between words/sentences.

Understand the meaning of something allows us also to perform ontology
learning, so mapping concepts together.

In order to be able to do all of this, we need **distributional semantics**.
